## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a Computer Science student at Esa Unggul University with a strong passion for technology. Currently, I work part-time as a programming tutor, specializing in Python, at a learning center. Additionally, I serve as the PIC for the Google Developer Group on Campus, where I actively organize tech-related activities for students.

I have a deep interest in software development and technology, particularly in web and mobile development. I have worked on various projects, ranging from a Laravel-based restaurant table reservation system to mobile applications built with Flutter. Furthermore, I am currently enhancing my skills in ReactJS and Data Structures & Algorithms to strengthen my programming logic.
